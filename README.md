## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### Useful resources

- [A modern Reset CSS](https://www.super-simple.net/blog/un-css-reset-moderno/) - This helped me to reduce browser inconsistencies. It's an evolution from the one I previously used, and includes new stuff such as animation and transitions removal for people who explicitly don't want them. 
- [BEM CSS framework](https://getbem.com/) - The official website for BEM framework. I'd recommend it to anyone who uses custom CSS properties.
- [W3Schools examples](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_dom_examples.asp) - This allowed me to understand better how vanilla javascript works for DOM manipulation.
